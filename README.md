# Python material for Homework series 2 of the TU Delft course on Data-Assimilation WI4475

This material can be found [here](https://github.com/robot144/wi4475_2020_homework2)

These files are needed to complete the homework series 2 exercise 2. There are several ways to work
with this material:

1. Start the python notebook on google's Colab. This requires a google account. The service is free for the small standard computational nodes.

2. Run your locally installed version of jupyter with this notebook. You need to install a few packages:
  - tensorflow
  - numpy
  - matplotlib

3. Work without jupyter in the classical way with dot-py source files.
